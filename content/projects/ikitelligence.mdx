# IKITELLIGENCE

**A daily “happiness lottery” based on the seven letters of IKIGAMI.**

_IKITELLIGENCE_ is a playful, research-based tool designed to foster psychological wellbeing across all layers of society — inspired by the Japanese concept of Ikigai. It blends self-reflection, gamification, and emotional intelligence to create a daily ritual of insight and connection.

### The 7 Letters of Wellbeing

Each letter of “IKIGAMI” represents a dimension of meaningful living. Users rate each dimension daily from **1 to 49**, in reference to the German Lotto (7 out of 49). The app turns reflection into rhythm — intuitive, accessible, and even a bit magical.

- **I – Interests**  
  _“Which activities do you regularly engage in that bring you joy?”_

- **K – Knowledge & Competence**  
  _“Which skills do you use frequently that bring you recognition and satisfaction?”_

- **I – Inspiration**  
  _“What or who inspires you daily and fuels your motivation?”_

- **G – Growth & Health**  
  _“Do you feel physically and mentally well and balanced?”_

- **A – Activity & Work**  
  _“Does your current professional role bring you satisfaction and a sense of meaning?”_

- **M – Meaningful Connections**  
  _“How satisfied are you with your social relationships and your support system?”_

- **I – Inner Peace**  
  _“Do you feel emotionally grounded and at peace with yourself?”_

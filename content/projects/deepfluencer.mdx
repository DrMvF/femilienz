# Radical Sensitive Creatorship  
A quiet revolution for creators, founders & leaders.

Born from a moment of overstimulation and silence. OMR. Lights. Noise. Performance. And the quiet ache behind it all: exhaustion, fragmentation, invisibility beneath visibility.

What began as a pulse became a mission:

To hold space for those who look fine – but feel undone.  
To name what’s been unnamed: **Personal Brand Fatigue**.  
To offer not advice – but sanctuary.

### Coming soon

This is just the beginning.  
**Full website launching soon** with Next.js and Vercel.

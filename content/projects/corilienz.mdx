### About Us

**Jasper** — hunter and treasurer of inner wealth  
**Miriam** — untamed wild soul, core reactor of courageous acts

We met in September 2021. We weren’t looking. We were simply ourselves. Our first encounter never let us go. It was clear: this was soul connection. We married secretly in March 2022. No one could stop us. Just do it. And do it well. In September 2022, our son was born — completing our family of five, with two proud sisters. Now we share our lived experience with you: A life full of joy, clarity, and deep creative love.

> “What we do today determines how the world looks tomorrow.”

### A couple, a mission

We’re building a life that’s wildly rooted — in love, in family, in truth. Corilienz is our way of showing: Yes, it’s possible. You can grow together, raise strong and joyful kids, lead from the heart, and still create bold impact.

# Radical Sensitive Leadership

A poetic, strategic space for those who lead with sensitivity.  
Born from research. Rooted in depth. Built on presence.

## Deep Flow

Daily reflections delivered as a private stream –  
a ritual of presence and poetic observation.  
Not for everyone, but for those who resonate.

---

## Radical Weekly

A build-in-public journal.  
One letter per week – on leadership, inner shifts, and the making of a psychological tech platform.

---

## Founding Circle

Full access, early insight, and co-creation.  
Founding members stand beside the work and shape what comes next.

---

## Offer White Space

This is not a product – it’s a field.  
Executive coaching at the edge of presence and clarity.  
For leaders who feel the call.

- Executive Clarity Session 
- Strategic Reset Package

## Research foundation

Radical Sensitive Leadership is grounded in my Master’s thesis (in German):

**"Berufung und Wohlbefinden von extrovertiert hochsensiblen Führungskräften: Konzeptentwicklung auf Basis einer multimethodischen Studie"**  
with Prof. Dr. Sven Sohr and [Dr. Mona Haug](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-monaverenahaug-b530a023/)
